# cursesgame
World's smallest gam,e to ever exist. i prommy

## how to play
make sure u have python on your device. best if it's 3.10+ bc im using match case in this thing

after that open command line and do `pip install windows-curses` if you're on a windows machine. if not then don't do anything I think? 

then literally just download the `main.py` file and open it in a terminal using `python3 main.py`/`python main.py` if you're on windows. or whatever works 

all the directions are in the game. heart emoji
